Our assignment for this challenge was to recreate a website based off of an image. The image they gave us had a website that was in a desktop format, so the mobile and large screen format was up to each student. We were allowed to take liberties with the subject matter of the website, the images, and text but not with the format. I chose to do my project on the Harry Potter books. I had the user information as the sorting hat, who was looking at the profile of Hermione Granger. The graphs represent her personality in two forms: her house affinities and her myers-brigg personality score. The rest of the website contains information about her and/or the wizarding world. I would like to work on getting the connect container (the one that containers the social media buttons and the options to copy links) to be the same size as the table container. I also want to continue working on fluidity in a website design. Below I have the image I was tasked to recreate and the webpage I made.
